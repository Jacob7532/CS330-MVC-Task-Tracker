# CS330-MVC-Task-Tracker
Final project for CS 330 - Design Patterns. I was required to create some sort of project using the MVC design pattern so I chose to make a Task Tracker using JavaScript, I made it while listing to the Disco Elysium OST.

In order to run this you must follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en

2. Open to the task-tracker directory within the terminal

3. enter the command: npm i

4. enter the command: npm start

5. It will open with a new tab in the browser.
